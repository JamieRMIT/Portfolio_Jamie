   <h2>Personal Information</h2>
   <p>Hi my names Jamie, A little bit about me I was born in Perth on June 20th 1998 to the child 5 and final child of Denys and Garnaut Riches. My Parents have a little bit more diverse background as my Father was born in Melbourne but has a large family tree Stemming back to French and Irish origins which led to his name being held as Garnault a family legacy to pass the name down to one sun of each generation. Now my mother was born in New Zealand and moved to Perth when she was young at the age of 9. A little bit more about my self I graduated year 12 in 2015 at Mazenod college before embarking into full time work as a sub contractor for the government which lead me down my path to working in fraud and compliance full time. I don’t have a lot a lot of personal time these days as work takes up a lot but I do spend a lot of time at the gym aswell as I went through a large change in the last 16 months loosing roughly 25kg in fat and changing my self mentally and physically.</p>

   <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
   <P>My Interest started when I was a little bit younger having to start up a computer that took 5 minutes to load up windows 95. Watching how far more advanced its come in the last 15 years amazes me put also help me understand that I.T doesn’t have an end but will always keep advancing and that is something that I want to help contribute to by being able to understand how all of it works in greater detail. The reason I chose RMIT is that I was looking for a few weeks at which uni would offer me the best flexibility to work online as well as also have lectures/tutors who cared about their student and helping them be successful, RMIT had a highly reputable back ground with a lot of great comments on different forums which lead me to enquire with them, it was as easy as a phone call before I got all of my emails and which course was best for me. I expect to learn in this course the basics of I.T how things work and also what really makes systems run, Having the ability to look at a website and be more understanding of what the basic coding behind it is and maybe one day be able to write/code my own website that is fully functional</P> </section>

   <H2>Ideal Job</H2>
   <h3>Cyber Security Analyst</h3>
   <p>What I think is a Cyber Security Analyst is, Someone who covers the security risk for all devices/internet side of a system aswell as testing them and making them safe from any future penetration attacks. This appeals to me because i enjoy being able to set u defences and having the ability to protect confidential things.</p>

   <h3>Skills i Have</h3>
   <p>The skills needed are going to be someone who thinks out side of the box and has the ability to work alone as well as in a team to be able to figure out and execute plans. Qualifications needed will be information technology with a cyber security degree major in it as the bare minimum. The experience needed for this is investigate incidents as well as fix vulnerabilities in systems. Conduct threat research and perform risk assessments and penetrations tests.</p>
   <h3>Skill i Need</h3>
   <p>I don’t think that I hold any specials skills as of right now I have basic information on computers systems but I don’t think this leads to being able to contribute to a cyber security or Information technology team in a successful matter at this current point.</p>


   <h3>Learning Plan</h3>

   <p>My biggest leap so far will be starting this degree as this degree will open my eyes and once completing give me a Information technology degree. After completing this I will move more into a cyber security degree and maybe a penetration/hacking degree as well, I believe this will only be the tip of the iceberg for now as how much I learn will really be how willing I am. I'm going to start using a lot of my spare time to learn more about HTML/XML as well as researching more into penetrations tests and commons threats in the cyber security world and how to fix them. as overtime I will starting indulging into more programs/systems I can learn I just don’t currently know what other things I need to learn about. When I hit the later stages of the degree and I have a better understanding I will be able to know what things I need to have better experience in meaning I will be able to understand and upgrade all knowledge and basics of said qualifications an skills.</p> </section>

<h2>Test Two</h2>
<H3>Learning Style</H3>
<p>Kinesthetics and tactile A kinesthetic-tactile learning style requires that you manipulate or touch material to learn. Kinesthetic-tactile techniques are used in combination with visual and/or auditory study techniques, producing multi-sensory learning.</p>

<h2>Test Three</h2>
<h3>The 5 Big Factors</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Factor 1 -81% Extroversion. individuals who score high on Factor I one are outgoing and social. Individuals who score low tend to be shut ins.</li>

</ul>

<H2>What do these Results mean to you?</H2>
<P>These results have given me the ability to understand more about my actions, while reading these I have noticed a lot of similarities. Such as always having an answer for things making me a quick thinker and knowledgably in a lot of different fields. I also learnt more about how I am a very hands on kind of worker with the ability to learn through trial and error is a lot better then just reading or watching a video on it. I also cant forgot the down sides though such as being very argumentative in most cases and doing anything it takes to win, showing me that there is a lot of things that I can improve in or enhance to not be such a large factor.</P>

<h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
<p>The results show that I am willing to learn and lean more to abstract ideas then the basic modern idea that’s looked at by everyone. Being knowledgably also means that I will want to expand my ability's and learn more on the things I'm studying so I can be a larger factor in my group and someone with a respected opinion. I will also be able to work well in a team as I'm able to speak with anyone and understanding of how they learn and adapt to them.</p>

<h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
<p>I would need to be looking for people who are on the same type of learning as me and willing to place them self out there so that we can debate on ideas and come up with the best one. I would be wanting a team who more trial and error and wanting to create things just to build them better the next time.</p> </Section>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Atm third party authentication, Everyone carries a phone these days and uses mobile banking. Why don’t we link these together more, Lets say your card is trying to buy a 500$ laptop at dick smith yet your phone is 4 hours away? This card allows a notification to be sent to your phone to confirm your making this purchase. You will be able to set how far away from your card you will be and set the amount that you want a warning at. This then allows the user to be able to have more safe conciseness over if they are at risk of the card being stolen/skimmed by someone else..</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>In 2020, over 4.7 million reports of fraud were recorded, an increase from the number reported in 2019 We all know at least one person who has had a fraudulent credit/Debit Card charge happen to them one time. The percentage of credit card fraud is only going up every year, there was 4.7 million reports of fraud recorded in 2020 with a result in 34% of these having an effect on money loss. With the ability to lower that percentage will make a huge difference in the long run knowing that you are safer with use of your credit card’s ability.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This third-party app will have the ability to be able to control how we look at the use of our credit cards and the safety that we hold behind them with more freedom and security and less risk. We all know someone that has had their credit cards or debits cards stolen in some sense before. Well now we have the ability to set a location lock on our phone to where our credit card is being used at. If our phone is at home and the card is being used 65km away it will send us a location on a purchase to have us confirm if this is us or not. This will be done through a third-party app that can monitor transaction by linking it to a designated bank account that you want to be monitored. You will have the ability to be able to set the location distance that you want the card to be used at and the amount that can be used before it start to send out Notification to you. I.E if your location is set to 10km and a purchase limit of 65$ then anything outside of those parameters will need to be verified on your phone to confirm that you’re currently making this purchase. Going more into depth about this, you will be able to also link other people’s phones through the original third-party app so that you will be able to have your significant other on the card as well and control which family members can use the card without having to worry if the has cards been stolen. This third party will also have the ability to track how far you originally were from the point of purchase and allow you to see the distance all other connected devices where at original point of sale. This mean you will have the ability to track everyone's spending as well as location more and keep a data timeline of how your purchasing is going and the time span that all of the purchases were made on. This gives you a real time update on spendings as well so that you can keep track of your finances and can help find out where you are spending a little bit too much money. The app will have one person who is in control of all the settings and is able to set the location and the amount of money that can be accessed from a distance, they can also switch the access of which people can use the card from what distance at the click of a button. This will allow families to have more control over the accessibility of the card and be able to track where any of the kids are using it through real time tracking as the third-party app will ping the locations of where and when the card is being used inside the app, allowing you to see the closest phone to that location as well.</p>

<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p>The Software needed to develop the app wont be anything to high tech, I think using a Simplify Application Development would allow you to build the app that is needed. The software needed would be able to connect to any banking app as a third party, and have the ability to track your geo location with inside the app. The app would also need to give real time updates as well meaning it would always have to be connected to the internet to have this ability. This would also mean you would need to have a phone for this app to be connected to as well as having a internet connection.</p>

<h2>Skills Required</h2>
<p>The Skills required for App development, The user will need to know how to use simplify Application development to begin with. And the knowledge to be able to use User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX). The ability for basic writing and design layout to make it user friendly and easy to navigate. Cloud Computing knowledge to be able to store all transactions and have them stored separately so that they can be access by a computer and different devices. Data expertise so that the app will run smoothly and not have any hiccups along the way making it more enjoyable for the user.</p>
 
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>The out come of the project will make a user friendly app that gives the account owners more control of how the money they have in there account is spent. They will be able to locate any transactions and the distance they were from the original transition and also be able to note which family member is using the card at what time by the geo location set on the app it self. Families will be have the freedom to be able to monitor the spendings easier. They will be able to eliminate any fraud that comes through from someone who has skimmed there card or simply found it in a lost hand bag by denying any purchases made out side of a certain range or over any amount of dollar as well. This means they can lock the card quicker knowing that none of the authorised people to use the card are in location needed.</p> </div>
